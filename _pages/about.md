Welcome to my personal homepage and thanks for visiting! \n
I am Daniel, a postdoctoral researcher at the New York University (NYU) Stern School of Business. My research focuses on how new technologies may reshape the future of our platform economy. Curiosity and a deep interest in new, digital technologies drives my passion for research and my eagerness to provide novel insights that help to create a more inclusive, transparent, and fair digital economy. I belief that technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain have the potential to lead us into a more fair and transparent future of digital platform but to reach this future, we need to better understand and quantify the economic forces accompanying these new technologies. 

Some of my ongoing research intends to understand: 

1. To what extent and what type of trust is still necessary on blockchain platforms?
2. What undesirable consequences result from replacing a platform intermediary with a market mechanism? 
3. Can fully decentralized systems be neutral (e.g., no prioritization based on willigness to pay)? 
4. How can we set up decentralized governance structures to balance decision making rights between platform owners and platform contributer? 
5. How much decentralization do we really need?
6. What drives multihoming decisions on blockchain platforms?

**Research Focus:** Platform competition, platform governance, blockchain technology

**Methodology:** Econometrics, ML (Textual analysis, deep learning), blockchain analytics

Beyond the research world (if time allows), I love to dabble in cyber security, explore the culinary world through cooking, play beach volleyball, and compete in online gaming.
