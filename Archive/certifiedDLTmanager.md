As a foundational technology, Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are the basis for future data-driven businesses and applications. The Blockchain-inherent decentralisation means a paradigm shift not only for technical architectures and processes but also for business models and society at-large. For enterprises and their managers, understanding Blockchain and DLT will be an essential component of their future work.

In this program on one of the most promising but also contentious technologies, participants learn how to implement and manage Blockchain and DLT, and how to unlock its potential for the enterprise. This Certificate Program covers the technical, business, social and legal aspects of blockchain-based solutions in a balanced and unbiased way.

The program consists of weekly live digital sessions, each of which requires about 1 hour of preparation. The course concludes with a group case study, which is also assessed with an exam. The program can be attended as an introductory course or as a more in-depth course.

As part of this course, I taught a week long session smart contracts.
