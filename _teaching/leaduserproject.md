The aim of the seminar is to develop innovative ideas within the framework of a real innovation project. In teams of four, together with the project partner, the students will go through the individual phases of a Lead User project. Student will identify trends in a jointly defined search field and then search for lead users and experts in the specified area. The seminar concludes with a Lead User workshop where innovative product concepts are developed for the project partner. The theoretical foundation is the Lead User method, developed by Eric von Hippel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Every semester a new project partner with an exciting new technology is selected. 

I taught this course several semesters, supervised the student teams, coordinated the project with our practice partners, and finally moderated the lead user workshop.
